# Mapping in R Workshop

Originally part of a workshop at the 2018 River Rally, titled "*Using R for Geospatial Mapping and Dynamic Visualization*"

It has since been updated and includes additional content, while still retaining the core of the workshop. 

The workshop at the 2018 [River Rally](https://www.rivernetwork.org/events-learning/river-rally/about/program/) demonstrated how to use R/ RStudio to work with spatial data for mapping and visualization.

No prior experience is necessary, participants use the free & open source [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) & [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) programs to:

 - become more proficient at data management/organization
 - download spatial and tabular data 
 - load, aggregate and summarize data
 - perform spatial operations commonly used in GIS programs (e.g., intersect, clip, buffer), 
 - plot and map data in both static (printable) and dynamic forms you can share or post online.
